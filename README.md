📈 Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA & SARIMA Models 📊

Excited to share my recent work where I explored time series forecasting by predicting monthly champagne sales using classical statistical models!

🔍 Overview:

Analyzed the Perrin Freres Champagne Sales dataset (1964–1972)

Performed data cleaning, visualization, and stationarity testing using the ADF Test

Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals

Built predictive models using:

✅ ARIMA – for capturing non-seasonal patterns

✅ SARIMA (SARIMAX) – to model and forecast seasonal variations effectively

📊 Highlights:

Applied rolling statistics and differencing techniques to achieve stationarity

Compared results from ARIMA and SARIMA visually — SARIMA produced more accurate forecasts due to the clear seasonal structure

Gained practical experience with ACF/PACF plots, residual diagnostics, and parameter tuning

🧰 Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Seaborn

This experience has strengthened my understanding of time series analysis and forecasting, laying a strong foundation for diving into advanced models like Facebook Prophet and LSTM.
